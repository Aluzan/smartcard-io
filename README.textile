h1. intarsys smartcard-io

h2. Overview

This project contains a PC/SC wrapper and smartcard abstraction layer. 

In addition an alternative javax.smartcardio provider is provided.


h2. Build

The project is committed as a self contained Eclipse project and should compile without problems there.

Anyone in Ant is kindly asked to provide a script... (as for maven)

h2. Dependencies

First of all, we need **some** code from the intarsys runtime. This is included in the "lib" 
dependencies. The code itself is BSD licensed and again hosted at Github at "intarsys/runtime".

Second, the native code is accessed via JNA in conjunction with the intarsys native platform 
model (as we (1) didn't like the JNA provided one (2) have introduced a very small provider interface 
for decoupling from JNA or any other implementation). Both libraries are included in the "lib" folder.
The code for the intarsys native abstraction is BSD, available at Github, "intarsys/native-c".

h2. Usage

A pre-build jar file is available in the "deploy" folder. Together with the dependencies in "lib", add
to the classpath for your project.
